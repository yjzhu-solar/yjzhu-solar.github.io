I"ï<p>Solar flares are one of the most energetic eruptive events in the solar system. Literally, a solar flare is a sudden enhancement in brightness in the solar atmosphere. It releases the magnetic energy restored in the solar atmosphere to heat to solar atmosphere, emit radiation at different wavelengths, and accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs). An X-class flare could release energy more than \(10^{32}\) erg in a few minutes, which is equivalent to \(\sim 10^{10}\) atomic bombs.</p>
