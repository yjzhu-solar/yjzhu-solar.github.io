I"€<p>I am taking the SPACE597 Space Plasma Physics taught by Prof. Tamas Gombosi this semester. The final project of this graduate-level course is to simulate a coronal mass ejection (CME) and compare the simulations with observations using Alfv√©n Solar Model (AWSoM) and Eruptive Event Generator, Gibson and Low (EEGGL) on UCAR Cheyenne. I will write down the progress in my project in this blog.</p>

<p>I was assigned to simulate a Halo CME erupted on September 10, 2014 at a linear speed of \(\sim 1267\ \mathrm{km\cdot s^{-1}}\) close to the sun. The CME is triggered by an X1.6 flare occured at UT 2014-09-10 17:45.</p>

<p>Halo CME means that it aims at the earth directly. The following joint observation of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite and Large Angle and Spectrometric COronagraph (LASCO) on board SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) shows the halo-shape CME and the brightening post flare loops in the active region (AR) 12158.</p>
