I"æ<p>The Solar flare, literally sudden brightening, is one of the most energetic eruptive events in the solar system. An X-class flare could release energy more than \(10^{32}\) erg in a few minutes, which is equivalent to \(\sim 10^{10}\) atomic bombs. It releases the magnetic energy restored in the solar atmosphere to heat to solar atmosphere, create bulk motions of plasma, emit radiation at different wavelengths, and accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs). The solar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission increase by a few orders of magnitude during a flare eruption, which has a huge impact on earthâ€™s ionosphere and radio communications. The SEPs can be accelerated to more than tens of MeVs and threaten the operation of the spacecrafts.</p>

<p>Since in-situ measurements of a solar flare in the solar atmosphere is impossible, we obtain most of the information about a flare eruption by remote sensing</p>
