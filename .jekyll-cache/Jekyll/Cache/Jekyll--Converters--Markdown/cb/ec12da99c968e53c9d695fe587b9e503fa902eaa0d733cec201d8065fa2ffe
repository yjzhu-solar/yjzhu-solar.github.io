I"‘<p>My name is Yingjie Zhu (Êú±Ëã±Êù∞). I am a second year PhD student at Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering (CLaSP), University of Michigan. I work with <a href="https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/enrico-landi/" target="_blank">Dr. Enrico Landi</a> to understand what happens in solar atmosphere and heliosphere with spectroscopic observations. I received my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Peking University, where I found my interests in solar physics and astronomy.</p>

<p>I am also an ambassador of Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) at the University of Michigan. The DKIST is a 4m solar telescope built on Maui, Hawaii. It will have its scientific first light in 2020 and start a one-year commission phase. Before the arrival of DKIST data, I am attending several DKIST workshops on data reduction and analysis. When DKIST data is available, I am going to use the data from  Cryogenic Near-Infrared Spectropolarimeter (Cryo-NIRSP) and Visible Spectropolarimeter (ViSP) to investigate the physical properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs).</p>

<p>The Sun is the nearest star to the earth and influence the space weather of earth greatly. Frequent solar eruptions such as flares, corona mass ejections (CMEs) release a huge number of energetic particles as well as corona plasma.</p>
