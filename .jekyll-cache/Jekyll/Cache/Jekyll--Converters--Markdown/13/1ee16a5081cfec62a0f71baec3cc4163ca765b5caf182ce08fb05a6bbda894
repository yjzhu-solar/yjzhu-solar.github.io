I"ë<p>I am taking the SPACE597 Space Plasma Physics taught by Prof. Tamas Gombosi this semester. The final project of this graduate-level course is to simulate a coronal mass ejection (CME) and compare the simulations with observations using Alfv√©n Solar Model (AWSoM) and Eruptive Event Generator, Gibson and Low (EEGGL) on UCAR Cheyenne. I will write down the progress in my project in this blog.</p>
