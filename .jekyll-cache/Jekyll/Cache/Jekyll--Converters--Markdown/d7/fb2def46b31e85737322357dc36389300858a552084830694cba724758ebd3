I"|<p>Solar flares are one of the most energetic eruptive events in the solar system. Literally, a solar flare is a sudden enhancement in brightness in the solar atmosphere. An X-class flare could release energy more than \(10^{32}\) erg in a few minutes, which is equivalent to \(\sim 10^{10}\) atomic bombs.</p>
