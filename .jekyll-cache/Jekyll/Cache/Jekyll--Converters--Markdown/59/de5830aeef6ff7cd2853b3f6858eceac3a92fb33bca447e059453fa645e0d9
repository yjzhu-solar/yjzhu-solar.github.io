I"×<p>The Solar flare, literally sudden brightening, is one of the most energetic eruptive events in the solar system. An X-class flare could release energy more than \(10^{32}\) erg in a few minutes, which is equivalent to \(\sim 10^{10}\) atomic bombs. It releases the magnetic energy restored in the solar atmosphere to heat to solar atmosphere, create bulk motions of plasma, emit radiation at different wavelengths, and accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs).</p>
