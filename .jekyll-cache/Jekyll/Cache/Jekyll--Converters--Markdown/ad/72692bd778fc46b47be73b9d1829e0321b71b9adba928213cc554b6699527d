I"ñ<p>The Solar flare, literally sudden brightening, is one of the most energetic eruptive events in the solar system. , a solar flare is a sudden enhancement in brightness in the solar atmosphere. It releases the magnetic energy restored in the solar atmosphere to heat to solar atmosphere, emit radiation at different wavelengths, and accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs). An X-class flare could release energy more than \(10^{32}\) erg in a few minutes, which is equivalent to \(\sim 10^{10}\) atomic bombs.</p>

  <figcaption><i>Solar flares produce a huge amount of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission as well as solar energetic particles (SEPs), most of which have important impacts on the space weather of the Earth.</i></figcaption>

<p>Since in-situ measurements of a solar flare in the solar atmosphere is impossible, we obtain most of the information about a flare eruption by remote sensing</p>
