<p class="text-justify">Hi! My name is Yingjie Zhu (朱英杰), and I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering (CLaSP), University of Michigan. I received my Bachelor’s degree of Science from Peking University in 2019 before moving to Ann Arbor. Now I am working with <a href="https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/enrico-landi/" target="_blank">Dr. Enrico Landi</a> on spectroscopic observations of the million-degree solar corona.</p>

<p class="text-justify">My research focuses on understanding the physical processes in the solar atmosphere using spectroscopic diagnostics, including coronal heating, flare eruption, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Currently, I am working on Hinode/EIS and SOHO/SUMER observations of the off-limb corona. When I was an undergraduate, I ran radiative hydrodynamics simulations to investigate Mg \({\rm {\scriptsize II}}\) line profiles at solar flare ribbons. You can find more about my research <a href="/menu/writing.html">here</a>.</p>

<p class="text-justify">I am a homebody. I love practicing Chinese calligraphy and drawing cartoons. <a href="/menu/gallery.html">Here</a> are some of my imperfect works.</p>
