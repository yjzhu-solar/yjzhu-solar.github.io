My name is Yingjie Zhu (朱英杰). I am a second year PhD student at the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering ([CLaSP](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/){:target="_blank"}), University of Michigan. I work with [Dr. Enrico Landi](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/enrico-landi/){:target="_blank"} to understand different physical processes in the solar atmosphere with spectroscopic (and polarimetric in the future) observations. 

I received my Bachelor's degree of Science from Peking University, where I found my interests in solar physics and astronomy. I worked with [Dr. Hui Tian](https://www.space.pku.edu.cn/team/faculty/304894.htm){:target="_blank"} on various projects, including analyzing the formation of an S-shape flare ribbon observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the New 1m Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) and practicing spectroscopic diagnostics on another solar flare observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). 

During the summer of 2018, I worked with Dr. Adam Kowalski at the National Solar Observatory, University of Colorado Boulder on radiative hydrodynamics simulations of solar flares with RADYN and RH code. We compared the synthetic Mg II line profiles with some IRIS observations  

I am also an ambassador of Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) at the University of Michigan. The DKIST is a 4m solar telescope located at Maui, Hawaii. It will have its scientific first light in 2020 and start a one-year commission phase. Before the arrival of DKIST data, I am attending several DKIST workshops on data reduction and analysis. When DKIST data is available, I am going to use the Cryogenic Near-Infrared Spectropolarimeter (Cryo-NIRSP) and the Visible Spectropolarimeter (ViSP) to investigate the physical properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

The Sun is the nearest star to the earth and influence the space weather of earth greatly. Frequent solar eruptions such as flares, corona mass ejections (CMEs) release a huge number of energetic particles as well as corona plasma.
