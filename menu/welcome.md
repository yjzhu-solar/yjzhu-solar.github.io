Hi! My name is Yingjie Zhu (朱英杰) and I am a second year PhD student at the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering (CLASP), University of Michigan. I received my Bachelor's degree of Science from Peking University in 2019 before I moved to Ann Arbor. Now I am working with [Dr. Enrico Landi](https://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/enrico-landi/){:target="_blank"} on spectroscopic observations of the million-degree solar corona.

My research focuses on understanding the physical processes in the solar atmosphere using spectroscopic diagnostics, including coronal heating, flare eruption, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Currently I am working on Hinode/EIS observations of a southern coronal hole. When I was an undergraduate, I ran radiative hydrodynamics simulations to investigate Mg \\({\rm {\scriptsize II}}\\) line profiles at solar flare ribbons. You can find more about my research [here]({% link menu/writing.md %}).

I am an extremely lazy and indoor person. I love practicing Chinese calligraphy and drawing cartoons though I never received any professional trainings. Some of my poor works are shown in my [Gallery]({% link menu/gallery.md %}).
