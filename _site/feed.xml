An X-class flare could release energy more than \(10^{32}\) erg in a few minutes, which is equivalent to \(\sim 10^{10}\) atomic bombs. It releases the magnetic energy restored in the solar atmosphere to heat to solar atmosphere, create bulk motions of plasma, emit radiation at different wavelengths, and accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs). The solar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission increase by a few orders of magnitude during a flare eruption, which has a huge impact on earth’s ionosphere and radio communications. The SEPs can be accelerated to more than tens of MeVs and threaten the spacecrafts in space. Therefore, understanding the physical mechanism of solar flare eruptions are important&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solar flares produce a huge amount of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission as well as solar energetic particles (SEPs), most of which have important impacts on the space weather of the earth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since in-situ measurements of a solar flare in the solar atmosphere is impossible, we obtain most of the information about a flare eruption by remote sensing (i.e. telescopes collecting photons/EM waves). The following figure shows some examples of space-based or ground-based telescopes: Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) is an NASA spacecraft launched in 2010. It was designed to monitor the sun 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO has taken more than 200 million images of the sun in ultraviolet. Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) carries a spectrometer with high-spatial resolution to investigate the plasma dynamics in the chromosphere and lower transition region. Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is a brand-new ground-based solar telescope in Maui, Hawaii. The 4-meter telescope and state-of-art instruments will help scientists to investigate the unresolved mysteries in the solar atmosphere with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solar flares can be observed by spacecrafts in the space (e.g., SDO, IRIS) or ground-based telescopes (e.g., DKIST).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

Then the expectation value of an Operator \(\hat{A}\) is 
\[
    \braket{A} = \int f(\lambda) \braket{\psi(\lambda)|\hat{A}|\psi(\lambda)} \mathrm{d} \lambda

or 
\[
    \braket{A} = \sum_i f_i \braket{\psi_i|\hat{A}|\psi_i}

\[
\hat{\rho} \equiv \int \mathrm{d}\lambda f(\lambda)\ket{\psi(\lambda)}\bra{\psi(\lambda)}

\[
\hat{\rho} \equiv \sum_i f_i \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i}

s.t. \(\braket{A} = \mathrm{tr}(\hat{\rho}\cdot \hat{A})\) , which can be easily proved as follows:
\[

\mathrm{tr}(\hat{\rho}\cdot \hat{A}) &amp;amp;= \sum_j \bra{\psi_j} \hat{\rho}\hat{A}\ket{\psi_j} \newline
